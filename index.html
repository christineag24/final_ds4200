  <h1> Analysis of Global Mental Health Trends</h1>
  <h1> Authors: Christine Guarnieri, Alex Mathias, Max Schnock</h1>


  <h2> Topic Introduction </h2>
  <p> Mental health disorders are more prevalent and more treatable than ever. Understanding the global and
    chronological trends for various illness groups can provide insight to the most critical treatments, as well as
    encourage further investigation into the potential sociocultural contexts and causes. Mental healthcare is
    imperative to a healthy and prosperous society, and historical and statistical understanding is crucial to
    addressing the modern crisis. It is important to look at this to see if there are countries with more underlying
    issues consistently over time or to be able to examine if there was an influx of a certain illness at a certain time
    period. If that is the case, it could lead to more research into the underlying factors of why this was a
    wide-spread issue at this time. This is an interesting analysis as mental health is not always looked at from a
    country to country state and such an analysis could reveal interesting information.

  <h3> Relevant Papers</h3>
  <p>
    For more information outside of our project on related topics, we have included two reference papers for your
    convenience. The first is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10689059/">“Changing trends in the
      global burden of mental disorders from 1990 to 2019 and predicted
      levels in 25 years”</a> by Yang Wu et.al.,. This paper walks through how mental disorder rates and trends vary
    over time
    and it includes predictions for the years to come. This paper also considers variables such as gender and age when
    conducting the analysis. The second relevant paper is <a
      href="https://ourworldindata.org/how-are-mental-illnesses-defined">“How Are Mental Illnesses Defined?”</a> written
    by Saloni Dattani. This paper outlines the symptoms and potential causes of various different mental illnesses. This
    has potential relevance for being able to interpret results from our analysis with the added context of what the
    mental illnesses entail.
  </p>

  <h2> Data Introduction</h2>
  <p> We obtained a dataset called “Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder” from <a
      href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder">Kaggle.</a>
    It has 11 columns, including an indexing column. The other columns, not including the indexing column, are Entity,
    Code, Year, Schizophrenia %, Bipolar Disorder %, Eating Disorder %, Anxiety Disorders %, Drug Use disorders%, and
    Depression %. It contains 108552 data points of information for various dates, countries, and mental health
    illnesses. This data is able to be used in csv form and loaded into various programming softwares so we can conduct
    analysis on the set. This dataset has a unique set of information for each country over the years which will allow
    us to conduct a thorough analysis of the data over time. We also used geospatial data for the world from <a
      href="https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/world-administrative-boundaries/export/?flg=en-us">Open
      Datasoft</a> of country boundaries. This data allowed us to look at every country from our global mental health
    dataset at one time.
  </p>
  <p> Our data aims to look at global mental health trends over time. To get a basic understanding of our data. We
    created a simple scatter and line plot to see if global mental health was trending towards and increase or a
    decrease.</p>

  <h3>Global Mental Illness Over Time</h3>
  <div class='container'>
    <div class='image'>
      <iframe src="Visualizations/scatter_over_time.png" width="100%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class='text'>
      <p> This graph took the average percentage of the world for each year 1990-2017 and plotted the point on the
        graph. As we can see, there is a clear upward trend over time for this graph. This upward trend means the
        percentage of populations afflicted by some mental illness globally is increasing. This lead us to dive deeper
        into what specifically was causing this increase. We wanted to examine if this increase is because a a few
        specific disorders or if there was a general increase across all mental illnesses.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Mental Illness Specific Trends over time</h3>
  <div class='image'>
    <iframe src="Visualizations/disorders_over_time.png" width="100%" height="1250" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
  <div class='text'>
    <p> These graphs show that the majority of mental illnesses are trending upwards from the time span of 1990 to
      2017. Bipolar disorder, anxiety, Schizophrenia, substance abuse, and eating disorder are all clearly trending
      upwards. Alcohol use was trending upwards for a while, has a sharp decline hitting its lowest and 2005 before
      increasing until 2010 where it appears after 2010, it is trending downwards. Interestingly, the only mental
      disorder consistently trending towards is depression. This helped us to answer the question above regarding is
      this global increase in mental illnesses due to a specific disorder. We have learned that the vast majority of
      mental illnesses are trending upwards and mutually contributing to the incrasing global average of mental
      illness.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Relationship between disorders</h2>
  <p> We then wanted to see if there was a relationship between any of the mental disorders and each other. We started
    by looking at depression and alcohol use. </p>

  <p>
  <h3>
    Scatter Plot Showing Relationship of Substance Abuse and Depression
  </h3>

  <script src='https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js'></script>
  <script src='main.js'></script>

  <div class='container'> <svg id="plot"></svg> </div>
  <div class='container'>

    <p> This graph showed us that there was not a clear relationship between the two disorders. While this does not
      mean that other disorders aren't related to each other, it shows that depression and alcohol use, the only two
      disorders that were not consistently trending upwards, do not have a clear relationship with each other.
    </p>
  </div>




  <h2>Country Analysis</h2>

  <p> We started to conduct our country by country analysis. We started by taking a look at the United States, the
    country we all reside in.</p>

  <div class='container'>
    <div class='image'>
      <iframe src="Visualizations/us_2017_bar.png" width="100%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class='text'>
      <p> This graph shows the most recent data, 2017, for the United State for each mental disorder by percentage.
        Based on this graph, a much higher percentage of the population are affected by depression and anxiety than are
        affected by bipolar disorder or eating disorders. Based on this, we created a comparative bar graph.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <h3>Country Side-By-Side Comparison</h3>
  <div class='text'>
    <p> This graph allows the selection of a second country to compare against the United States. To make use of this
      interactive bar plots, the user can select any country from the dataset to compare to the United States across all
      mental illnesses to look at how the average percentage affected compares to each country. This reveals that
      not all countries have the same percentage of mental disorders or even have a similar distribution of
      percentage of mental disorders. With information like this, it creates questions of if certain mental
      illnesses are a more regional issue versus a global issue every country should uniformly address.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='center'>
    <iframe src="Visualizations/final_comparison.html" width="100%" height="325px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
  <div class='text'>
    <p> This graph reveals that there is a difference country to country compared to the United States. To start with
      comparing the United States to some of the other largest countries like India and China, United States has almost
      double the percentage of their population affected by eating disorders, anxiety, and drug use issues. However, all
      three of these countries were closer to each other in the percentage affected by depression and Schizophrenia.
      When moving to a different region, we compared the United States to several South American countries like Brazil,
      Chile, and Uruguay. The United States had a much higher drug use percentage than all these countries but these
      countries had a close, if not higher, percentage affected by alcohol use issues, with Brazil having almost double
      their population affected. We continued to look at some European countries, Germany, United Kingdom, and Sweden,
      as well as some African countries, Nigeria, Senegal, and Cote d'Ivorie. For the European countries, we found the
      ones we looked at were similar in percentages across the board to the United States. However, the differences
      between the United States and the African countries we selected was staggering. While the United States and these
      countries had similar percentages for bipolar disorder, every other percentage, the United States had
      significantly higher of their population affected, with the population affected by anxiety and drug use issues
      being almost triple those of Nigeria, Senegal, and Cote d'Ivorie. Based on this, we wanted to expand this
      comparison to the entire world all in one visualization.

    <h2>World Chloropleth Map</h2>

    <div class='text'>
      <p>As map was too large of a file to be contained, <a
          href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1trr1FTHJsOZ7x-Gl-rRp_M_cMiAJLhH0/view?usp=sharing'>Map Linked</a>, this
        is a link to a google drive html file that includes this interactive map, as instructed by Professor.</p>
      <p> In order to use this map, users can select the layers buttom on the right hand side and select as many layers
        or as few layers as they desire to be visible at once. This interactivity allows for the user to compare
        specific time frames or specific illnesses over the whole world to see if there is any regional or geographic
        details that can be discerned. </p>
    </div>
    <h3>1990 Legend</h3>

    <div class='image'>
      <iframe src="Visualizations/1990_legend.png" width="100%" height="180px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
    <h3>2015 Legend</h3>

    <div class='image'>
      <iframe src="Visualizations/2015_legend.png" width="100%" height="170px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class='text'>
      <p>This map reveals a lot of interesting information about the worldwide trends in mental health issues. Starting
        with drug_use, the countries that had a higher percentage affected by this issue are highly concentrated in
        North America, Oceania, and Northern Africa/Middle East. This remains constant in 1990 and 2015, suggesting that
        these percentages are not likely changing regionally what mental illnesses affect specific parts of the world.
        This map also revealed that South America and most of Eastern Europe had consistently low percentages of their
        populations affected by drug use issues. When looking at depression, in both 1990 and 2015, the spread of
        percentages of populations affect is much more mild with most countries in a similar range, except Greenland,
        the only country with over 6% of their population affected in both 1990 and 2015, suggesting some underlying
        reason in Greenland for this large of a difference. Eating disorders appear to be more prevelant in North
        America, Oceania, and Western Europe in both 1990 and 2015. Overall, this map reveals interesting information
        about the geographical spread of percentages of populations affected. </p>

  <h2>Summary and Additional Work</h2>
  <h3>Summary of Results</h3>
  <p>
    We are able to draw several interesting conclusions. Mental Health Illnesses in general appear to be trending
    upwards overall. This could lead to some interesting future work to see if there can be reasons as to why these
    illnesses have been trending upwards consistently over 20 years.
  </p>
  <p>Through our interactive comparison of graphs, we were able to determine that these increases in average mental
    illnesses are not the same for each country. When comparing countries against the United States, there are a lot of
    countries that were vastly different in average mental illness percentages. This means we cannot rule out that the
    increase globally is not applicable to all countries as some may have been trending downwards.
  </p>
  <p> Our interactive map graph was also able to show us the vast differences in concentration of mental illnesses. For
    example, eating disorders have a much higher percentage in North America than in Africa and South Asia. A more
    detailed analysis was included beneath the graph. THis showed us that there is merit to the idea that specific
    regions are driving up the increasing rates of mental illnesses globally. This would mean that the global mental
    health percentage for these illnesses is increasing but that is only true for specific regions.
  </p>
  <h3>Future Work</h3>
  <p>Based on this, we would consider future work in examining specific factors from country to country and if they
    could link to the difference in country but the overall upwards trend in global mental illnesses. We were able to
    see that not every country had the same trends. By diving furhter into regional or even country specific demographic
    information, we could be able to further see exact reasons why specific illnesses are increasing in one region but
    not in another. </p>
  <p>In future work, we would also want to get a more updated dataset. While this dataset provided a lot of great
    insight, the information stopped at 2017. With the Covid-19 pandemic occurring in 2020 and the rise of mental health
    concerns because of the pandemic, it would be useful to have more up to date data we could use to determine the
    potential influence of Covid-19 on mental health globally. </p>
